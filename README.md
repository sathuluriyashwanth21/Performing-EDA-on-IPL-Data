# Performing-EDA-on-IPL-Data
📌 Overview

This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Indian Premier League (IPL) cricket data to uncover insights about teams, players, and match outcomes. The analysis helps understand patterns, trends, and key performance metrics using Python.

The notebook demonstrates a complete data analysis workflow — from loading raw data to cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing it in a meaningful way.
